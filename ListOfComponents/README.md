The goal of this program is to detect all children classes of AbstractComponent, and create the corresponding enumeration in GulgECS/ComponentTypes.hpp

Auto generate the Component::Type enum, and fill the init function of ComponentSignatureKeeper 

TODO:

- Rework the files, add commentaries, split functions in files, etc...
- Delete "Component" in the names of the enum.
