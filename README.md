***Gulg Engine***

Game engine that I'm making in my free time. Based on an ECS design patern.

_Needed features for v0.3_
* Rework systems
* Rework meshs componants and transformations
* Work on a efficient system for a scene graph
* Work on a better system for keeping programs (and textures) in memory
* (Add memory manager ?)
* Continue light system, add Shadowmaps
* Add texturing on mesh
* Add bones and weight, then animation

_Need to work on it_
* Fix the Makefile problem
* Start documentation
* Start to think of a possibility of multithreading some systems
